Hello! My name is Thadeus Meneses, and I am currently a student at the University of Missouri studying computer science.
I am always eager to learn more and I want to track my progress as a programmer. So far, I am proficient in Java and C,
but I am learning HTML, CSS and javascript on my free time.
